                                        A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.<br>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.
                                        In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.<br>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19
                                        virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. Source: <a style="text-decoration: none;"

                                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between
                                    people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated
                                    from animals and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html"

                                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
                                    donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
                                    difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty
                                    breathing should seek medical attention.<br> Read more: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" style="text-decoration: none;">COVID-19 Symptoms from CDC.gov.</a>
